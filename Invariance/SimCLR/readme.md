# Simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations
This implementations contains the code for a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations (SimCLR).
- v1: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709 published in ICML 2020.


> [!NOTE]
> There exists SimCLR v2, but it is more of a semi-supervised learning method, and not end-to-end trainable 
> v2: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029 published in NeurIPS 2020.

> [!NOTE]
> For training it is important to ensure that the mini-batch contains balanced amount of samples from classes.
